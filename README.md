# Jose Muanza - Personal Website

![Site Preview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e569ef37-6714-4c40-b98f-8275c2774f61)

This is my personal website, created to centralize and showcase who I am as a programmer.  
The site uses the **GitHub API** to automatically fetch and display my projects, including private repositories I authorize, always sorted by the most recent updates.

In addition to the projects section, the site includes information about me, my technical skills, contact info, and everything that is part of my journey as a developer.
